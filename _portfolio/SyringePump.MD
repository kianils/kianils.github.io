## Project Overview

This DIY syringe pump project demonstrates precision fluid handling capabilities with flow rates ranging from 1 μL/min to 10 mL/min. The pump was designed and built as part of my digital fabrication minor coursework, showcasing both mechanical design and control system integration.

## Technical Specifications

- **Flow Rate Range**: 1 μL/min to 10 mL/min
- **Precision**: High-accuracy microfluidics control
- **Control System**: Programmable stepper motor control
- **Syringe Compatibility**: Standard medical syringes
- **Build Method**: 3D printed components with off-the-shelf hardware
